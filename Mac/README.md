### Mac Deployment
1. User need to have administrator privilege
    - `Kandji` bug, if the Macbook `Kandji` agent is installed as `standard user` there is a high chance the elevating user to `administrator` privilege would not work. (Require reformatting)  
    - `SAP Profile` App is used to determine the user privilege
2. Install Brew - Done (Use script provided by `Kandji` - [Link](https://support.kandji.io/support/solutions/articles/72000560518-deploying-homebrew-as-a-custom-script))
