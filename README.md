### Deployment Plan
#### Overview
1. Linux deployment - Jumpcloud
2. MacOS deployment - Kandji
3. Main slack channel - #temp_precommit_hooks_plan
4. Create Slack channel for respective team `temp_precommit_deployment_{TEAM_NAME}` in order to communicate with the team
5. A python server would be set up to receive deployment status through the deployment script - **does not have access to code**
    - Fail condition:
        - Once deployed, there will be a pre-commit test run on `https://github.com/harish-deriv/fake_repo_TEST9"` that has secret in it 
        - If no secret is detect, send a post request to the python server. 
        - **Note:** Due to the default users (i.e. root and deriv) false positive would occur
6. The deployment would need to be modified depending on the dev's environment
7. Set up a AWS Instance for the python server

#### Configurations
1. Two files would be created for the precommit configurations.  
    1. The first file would be a bash file that would contain the logic for the precommit secret scanner, created under `/opt/skel`.
    2. The second file would be the main precommit file that would be created under `<User's home path>/.git/hooks/pre-commit`. 
2. The main precommit file would invoke the bash script that is under `/opt/skel` whenever a commit is performed.

#### Alternative Suggestion
3. Alternative Method (Require Discussion)
    1. Instead of creating a bash script under `/opt/skel`, the bash script would be hosted on a public repository.
    2. The main precommit file would execute the bash script through `curl` and piped the output to `/bin/bash`.
    3. Reasons:
        - This would make maintaining the pre-commit much easier as future update can simply be preformed update the repository. 
        - There will no need for the MDM after the initial deployment.    

### QA Environment Deployment Plan
1. Dev's are developing and pushing code through QA Box instead of local machine 
2. Add pre-commit configuration to QA Boc `chef` code

### Edge Cases
1. If there are secrets in a brand new git repository (Does not have any commits before), trufflehog would not pick up the secrets.
    - One workaround would be to run `git log` on the repo if there is no commit it would return `exit code` of `128` instead of `0`
    - If it a new repo use `trufflehog filesystem .` instead of `trufflehog git file://.`    
    - This logic can be added to the pre-commit file
